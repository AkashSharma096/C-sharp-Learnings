# C# Learning Repository

This repository contains hands-on examples of fundamental and intermediate C# programming concepts. Each topic is demonstrated with a dedicated, self-contained project, making it easy to explore and understand specific concepts in isolation.

Whether you're a beginner learning C# for the first time or revisiting concepts for revision, this repo serves as a **practical reference guide**.

- **Inheritance** – Reusing and extending code using inheritance.
- **DynamicPolymorphism** – Runtime method overriding.
- **MethodOverride** – Overriding base class methods.
- **MethodHiding** – Using `new` keyword to hide base class methods.
- **Interfaces** – Implementing contracts for classes.

### 2. **Methods & Parameters**
- **Call by Value** – Passing parameters by value.
- **Call by Reference** – Using `ref` keyword to modify variables.

### 5. **Type Casting & Parsing**
- **Implicit Casting** – Automatic type conversion.
- **Explicit Casting** – Manual type conversion.
- **Parsing** – Converting strings to numeric types.
- **TryParse** – Safe parsing without exceptions.

### 6. **Object Initialization**
- **ObjectInitializer** – Initializing objects using initializer syntax.
- **Sample** – General object usage.

---

### 7. **Miscellaneous**
- **HelloWorld** – The traditional starting point in C#.
- **baseKeyword** – Accessing base class members from derived classes.
- **.DS_Store** – (MacOS system file, not part of learning content)

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio** or **Rider**.
3. Build and run individual projects to explore each concept.

## 🎯 Goal of This Repository
The aim of this repo is to:
- Provide **clear and isolated examples** of each C# concept.
- Help learners **practice by running and modifying** the code.
- Act as a **reference guide** for interviews and real-world coding.

---

## 📌 Next Steps
Planned future additions:
- Delegates & Events
- LINQ Basics
- Exception Handling
- Asynchronous Programming (async/await)
